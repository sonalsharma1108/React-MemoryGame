## What is a Memory Game?

This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different images. 

## Challenge

Match cards in less time with less moves and earn maximum star points.

## Instructions

* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

## How I built the Memory Game?

I manipulated DOM with ReactJS, altered parts of HTML and also styled the game

* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
